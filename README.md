# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview
This project scrapes data from various websites to create an new webpage that highlights latest facts and news about the planet Mars. I used splinter and beautiful soup libraries to scrape the relevant data. After my data retreival, I transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to my webpage using Flask then I used bootstrap to cleanup my webpage. 

Here is a screenshot of the final local website.
